## 🧠 Design Philosophy

SohanOS was built to reflect the mindset of an **innovator**. By moving away from standard scrolling portfolios to a structured desktop environment, it highlights the ability to build complex, stateful systems. Every animation, from the boot sequence to the window minimize-maximize effects, is crafted to provide a premium user experience.
